## PROJECT TITLE:
Bounty Hunters
## A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES:
- To create in mobile first a web application in which the users are immersed in the Wild West and sign up to catch the outlaw in the available missions created by a sheriff administrator.

- The registered user can sign up and unsubscribe from each search mission and will receive a message that he/she has signed up for the hunt with information about the hunt.

- Outlaw hunts have a deadline and expired ones will appear with a different design than the active ones.
